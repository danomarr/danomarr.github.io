DRAFT

Consider your company as an organism, rather than a computer.

What limits the growth of our company, and the things that we do? What about the important things like finding flow and getting started? The start is, after all, the most important part. How can I even begin if I don't let myself begin? There is a natural order that flows from chaotic stumblings. It is the way of nature, and has always been that way. If a stream of water is not free to start flowing the way it will, then it simply wells up until it bursts out. And if it is funneled from its source through a straight tube…don't you find it an unnatural sight? Thinking of the LA river, it is hardly a beautiful sight. At least, in its heyday when it was all clean and "perfect," it lacked a vibrance that only comes from randomness and mess of natural flow.

There is a reason gardens and wabi-sabi have such a beautiful effect on the eye. They follow the natural path of life, even if pruned to be most beautiful. Rather than form or shape how they are, they are celebrated in their uniqueness and natural way. Nature becomes the guide, and human hands are there to tend the natural progression of life––to cut away the unwanted scrap and weeds, and let the spring flourish with blooms and green.

I remember the Japanese gardens when my family stayed in Kildrummy castle, in Scotland. It must have been the most beautiful gardens I'd ever seen. By comparison, Versailles was impressive, sure––but it failed to inspire any recognition of beauty in my eyes. It was as warped and twisted like the aristocratic tyrant who made it. There is no beauty in excess.

How might this apply to work? Can wabi-sabi and gardening be applied to how I think of work? There is a saying about a gardener, something to the effect of "the farmer must first feed himself." I believe it comes from the book of Timothy. This axiom has two meanings, as I see it. One, that I cannot be much help to others so long as I am helpless myself. "Secure your mask before assisting others." See? It's a universal truth we can't sneak around. But another perspective on it is this: I contribute to whatever systems are around me.

A forced fit maybe. But the point is this: A farmer cannot ignore his own participation in his farm. He is not the source of problems or solutions, but he plays an important part of the whole. A gardener is not the "driving force" of the garden, he is only the keeper.

And if we are a whole group of farmers and gardeners at our jobs––then we are not the "driving forces" at our work, but the keepers of our work. So easily  leadership forgets that they are not kings, but gardeners. I too, forget that I am a gardener, and everything I do has an effect on our garden.

The analogy breaks down a little when we start exchanging flowers for projects and trees for people and red tape for weeds. But the underlying principle holds. In the Fifth Discipline, Peter Senge illustrates how systems thinking is an uncommon perspective in the work world. We tend to think of organizations as machines that respond to direct orders the way a computer can. Input this, get the expected output. But organizations follow a much more, surprise, *organic* way of being. Systems thinking helps understand how I, we, can understand and affect the system.

Naturally, we are always affecting the system. But the key difference isn't that the system is affected just because I am there, in it. But it responds to every interaction I am a part of, and not a part of. The interactions have impact.

Everything affects everything else. And while this might seem or feel overwhelming, it is no different than a garden. Life goes.

**So what point do I want to make here?**

**I want to say:**

I have an impact, whether I mean to or not. As do you, your receptionist, your managing director, and your CEO. The problems I see in my organization, the frustrations I have, I am participating in creating. It doesn't mean it is my fault, or my responsibility even. But when I acknowledge that I am co-creating the very problems that frustrate me, then I become less frustrated by them. And if everyone were to realize we are co-creating our own difficulties, then we have the space to dialogue about the root of the problem. When we take that space we can collaborate to a achieve a different output.

So why don't we?

It's a matter of purpose. Senge, also in the Fifth Discipline, points out how important a meaningful purpose is to an organization. A vision that people can really believe in is essential to any kind of growth or success. So what does your company believe in, really? Is its purpose just to make money?

The difficulty is just how existential the question is. If I was asked, point blank, "Well Daniel, is your purpose to eat and breathe until to you die?" I would say "Of course not!" And then I would frustrate myself over what the hell my life purpose is, darkly conclude I am hopeless, that I'll never know my true purpose, and I might as well shut up and get back to work because it doesn't even matter. Or that I'll figure it out tomorrow. Better to just keep my head down and keep moving than face the question.

The thing is, this too is a symptom of a perpetuated system. Somewhere, a story popped up that purpose is discovered out in the desert, alone on a mystic journey by some heroic figure who became a charismatic CEO super-person and led his people to the promised land of milk and honey and amazing work. Compelling as the hero's journey is, it is a myth. Purpose isn't found solo, but in dialogue with others. It is discovered, and shaped, and shared in community.

Of course, if begins and ends with me––that is my life and where I am able to have most direct impact––but I am only part of the whole. As Nina says, "Stand tall, stay small." Be proud of my ability, but humble in my place.
