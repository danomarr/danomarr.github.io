What is school for? Seth Godin presses the question in [this TED talk][sg-stop-stealing-dreams].

School is for exploring and trying and finding out. It is a safe environment to make mistakes and build confidence and grow the willingness to go for it. School is for questions, not answers. Butâ€¦isn't that kind of pre-concluded and prescriptive?

What if school was also for something else? What if school was for teaching adults rather than children? What if school was for undoing all the restrictive thinking trained into us that started when we were 7? What if school was for learning empathy and bravery, not just skills and creativity?
