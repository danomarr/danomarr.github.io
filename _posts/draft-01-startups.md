Yesterday, I came across a [post by Sara Parmenter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/the-elephant-in-the-room/), an accomplished web designer and highly effective self-marketer. She claims the world of web design work is changing, even "drying up." If the work is disappearing, then it must be because the market is oversaturated with designers and developers, making it difficult for would-be clients to choose reputable agencies and freelancersâ€¦or they're moving them in-house.

The reason is because it is so incredibly easy to start a company today. The overhead is low. The appeal and abundance of quality designers is high. The same goes for developers. It seems cheaper to sell digital products than physical ones, so many graduates of competitive programs and companies "start-up" an agency, because they'd rather do it their own way.

My friends and I had a idea three years ago. We sensed a market need for brand new startups to create convincing pitch decks to win business and/or investment. Coincidentally, it was a confluence of our three skill sets: I crafted graphic design and user experience, Clifton knew business and accounting, and Eric was a great marketer and salesman.

Incidentally, we quickly learned that the business wasn't viable. Customers and investors needed to see more than a pretty pitch deck with a slick logo. They wanted hard proof that this "thing" was worth their money. So we expanded our offer to consulting, where we would help our clients understand *how* to structure their business and accounting. Then it expanded to advising them on product design or customer experience. By then, we were practically selling a "boot up" offer, where we would create a perfect framework for entrepreneurs and get them running for a flexible price or a fixed amount of equity. It was the Inception of startups.

So meta.

It failed. The lesson was that the importance of messaging comes up short without a quality product or business powering it. So we aimed to tackle the product and business, and that didn't scale. Turning the mirror on ourselves, we learned the importance of sticking to a clear value proposition for a niche audience who could pay, and would want what we had to offer *repeatedly.*

The web industry appears to be facing a similar identity crisis. Companies are bringing designers and developers in-house. Or bringing teenage sons and daughters to "run social media for us" instead of hiring professional message-makers. Why? I think it is for the same reason that Clifton, Eric, and I had trouble serving startups.

Message is nice, but as the design adage goes, "content is king." The product is the content of the message, and the product's quality is a reflection of the company; the company a reflection of its people.

The work world is changing (not as fast as we think, but more than we imagine.) Startups have been an exciting new bubble, and with the recent woes of Unicorns (the rare startups valued over $1 billion) turning into Zombiecorns (startups with no active revenue), comes the proclamation that RABBITs (Real Actual Businesses Building Interesting Tech) will be the future.

The future is rapidly decentralizing from the industrial model (of brick and mortar, role-based employment), and more companies are popping up with new experiments on how to survive the new economy. It might be that we will face a mass-extinction of companies in the near future. The Four Horsemen (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple) gobbling up all the best newcomers, with everyone else fending for themselves, scrambling to find something to do.

In the event that the world is thrown in to total (professional) chaos, then people and companies most adaptive to change will survive best. One of the core principles of surviving change is "don't go alone". If you don't go alone, then who do you trust? And why?
