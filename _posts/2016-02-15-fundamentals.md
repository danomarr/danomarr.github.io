How are code and martial arts similar?

I am not an master of either. Being a master is knowing the right thing to do, at the right time, in the right measure. And mastery needs diligent, aspirational practice. Constantly.

Both code and martial arts are a practice. By showing up, learning something new, and applying it, it sinks in and slowly becomes understood. You have learned a skill you can use in a similar situation later. This takes time.

There are fundamentals. Athleticism and intellect allow you (me) to skip these if you want. This is the blessing and curse of talent. But skipping the basics builds an unstable foundation with many weaknesses that will cost you and make bigger problems later. Hacking and shortcuts and brute force may get the job done today––but in the long run the master who practices the fundamentals is superior.
