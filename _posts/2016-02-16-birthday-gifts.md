I turn 27 today, and I've been asking myself—what is the important stuff happening in my life? What am I doing that matters? Am I boldly sharing who I am, making good and sincere and generous art? Where have I been holding back? Why do I willingly go to work everyday, unless I do what is important?

I think of Pablo Picasso. At some point, his life became his art. Everything he did glowed *Picasso.* He lived his signature. Einstein too, a clever wit and imaginative observer of the secrets of the universe. What I like about Seth Godin is he is also 100% genuinely himself, though maybe not on the level of Picasso or Einstein. Every interest and speech of his exudes his rough-shod, tells-it-like-it-is style.

Which is why I love Seth Godin's provocation to "Pick Yourself. No one else will." I think I floated along (and maybe still have, to some degree) on the myth that someone will recognize my potential and whisk me away to great heights. No, that Hollywood fantasy is never how it worked in real life. It's on me. The responsibility, the action, and the consequences are all on me.

Seth mentions Steven Pressfield in his [interview with Tim Ferriss][tf-seth-godin] (which you should definitely give a listen) and his philosophy about Resistance. "Picking yourself" and doing the work that matters to you does not preclude you from obstacles or difficulty. In [The War of Art][sp-war-of-art] Pressfield calls Resistance the force that most strongly interrupts us from our Art, our purpose, that thing that is most important to us. Our art is shrouded in Resistance. It will never be a good time to do the important thing, it will never be easy to dance with the fear, and it will never stop or give in. It is almost the true north to the compass of purpose, wherever the purpose calls, Resistance follows like a hulking shadow. In C.S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters (which I also highly recommend, especially the audiobook with [John Cleese narrating][csl-scretape-letters])  Lewis wittily takes on the perspective of a demon in upper management hellbent on subverting the Calling of humans at all costs, suggesting that his impish pupil do everything in his power to stop the human from doing what is important—and if all else fails, encourage the human to write a book about it (it feels so productive, but produces so little.) The point of course, is that all distractions keep me from doing what I'm meant to do at my core, and I shouldn't expect them to lighten up the closer I get, but I can expect that the nearer I am to that kernel, the better and more worthwhile it is to face Resistance.

So for my 27th birthday I'm giving myself a gift: my own permission. I'm giving myself the chance to work on projects that matter to me in the same way things mattered to me when I was six years old. And I won't be doing them because other people say I should, or out of guilt that I'm not in vogue as an entrepreneur or any other obedience-driven motivation. Like I said in a [previous post][gardens-not-machines], people are gardens to cultivate. We take time and patience and care. All my projects (this blog, my paintings, my workshops, my strategies, my martial arts, and even any coding) and especially the people around me (my girlfriend, my family, my friends, my coworkers) are gardens to tend with generosity, humility, sincerity, and love.

Today I continue to tend my gardens and again choose to be attentive.
