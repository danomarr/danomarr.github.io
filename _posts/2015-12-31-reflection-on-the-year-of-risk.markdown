### First, a word

So much has happened this year. Each January, I meditate on the year ahead, and a word strikes me to theme the year. My friend Maidson Ainley spurred me onto this habit. 2015 was the Year of Risk, and it took a turn I did not expect.

What I learned about "Risk" is how dependent it is on intuition. And I discovered how trusting my gut has a lot of worth to me. I learned there is a deeply satisfying feeling from being honest and speaking what is true to my spirit. What is maybe obvious for some, does not come naturally to others like me. It used to be so easy to dodge and play down the importance of speaking frankly. I am good at tact. But blunt is important. It is one reason why I like Ernest Hemingway so much. There is no question about what he means. There is no decoration. It is just true. And if it isn't objectively true, it doesn't matter. It is true to him.

For most of my life, I have pushed hard to find a kind of objective truth that applies to and includes everybody. Maybe there is one. And that push is a pursuit of the intellectual kind, something theoretical and abstract.  It is intangible and far away, and the more cosmic I would get, the less connected I felt to reality. I followed that rabbit hole down a thesauraus of big words and odd analogies. I built castles in the sky, as the saying goes. Ornate and convincing castles, maybe, but still unreachable and mostly meaningless. If I ever met a real philosopher, I don't know how long the conversation would last. I would be outmatched and undereducated, because my pursuits of "objective reality" departed from the sciences and mathematics a long time ago. And I definitely have not applied the rigor to understanding the classical or modern philosophers to really say I know much of anything about philosophy. What Nassim Taleb calls a [philosophaster][philosophaster] (an amateur or charlatan philosopher) is a much closer term to where I have been. I am not so self-important to think that I've contributed anything important to the world of understanding objective reality. In fact, it's a bit dry and boring for the body and soul when my mind goes wandering off without me. And that is where I found myself at the beginning of the year in 2015.

What I have learned this year is more a remembering more than a revelation, a rediscovery more than a new idea, and a reversion more than a refinement. In many ways, I feel more like there is an ageless child in me I am meeting for the first time in a long while. I am very happy to see him again. This is my reflection on the year that introduced he and I.


### Provoked into feeling

Attending [Hyper Island][hyperisland] changed me. I arrived at the school with a bit of self-importance and ambition to "get to the top" socially and professionally. I spent most of my energy trying to help others learn as opposed to learning myself. That didn't work! But I think I learned and changed. Today I hope I am a bit more present and humble. I hope I actually have learned some things (and not fooled myself into believing I did!), and I hope I am a bit more self-aware now than I used to be.

I remember during the first week of school, I noticed I tried to separate myself from my classmates by imitating our program facilitators. Desperately, I clutched at a kind of security I was familiar with––associating myself with roles of authority––and leaving my own personal development behind in the meantime. I remember believing that ambition and achievement *were* personal development,  and that learning the most stuff and getting the respect of everyone else was the end goal. I believed self-discipline was more or less coercing, manipulating, or forcing my weak animal body and brain to behave as I was thought I was supposed to. When I failed, that only confirmed my lack of self-discipline. Now, after a year and some months of challenges to that way of thinking, I see things differently.

What I have learned is my soul is already complete, and is full of natural curiosity and eagerness and aspiration on its own. Like a seed, all the forces of life and growth are already there. It only needs nurturing. The process is a discovery by removing the fetters and fears that keep my soul hidden from me.

This spring, a Danish woman with *real gravitas* ran a proactive planning workshop for our class. Her name was Ouafa. I expected a heavy and logically intense couple of days where we would talk about hard ambitions and strategic methods to accomplish our SMART goals. I suppose we still did that. But the personal reflection impacted me much more. It was close to psychological therapy––she challenged us to dive into our past accomplishments that stirred up the most pride, and extract the meaning of those moments. In the same workshop, I was paired up with my classmate Sini Øh to help each other see our blind spots. She is a tough and strong woman. Until then we never really talked much. We told each other our life stories. I offered my thoughts, which of course I hope helped her some. She offered hers, striking me to the core. I realized two things: First, I was living a near copycat life, swallowing whole a prescription of a "good life" as written by my parents (bless them). Second, I had a vision of a suit of armor, an automoton following orders. Inside was a small potted plant, young and green but still tender and sprouting. That image has stayed with me all year.

I remember when my classmate Emily Ryan (who I respect a thoroughly, but I've had a hard time connecting with, one-on-one) called me out in front of the class. I had just explained how I believed everyone has a lot of untapped potential and that I could or should help them to unlock that potential. Really though, I didn't know what I meant, or what drives me, and so I gave lip service to the closest thing I could think of that no one would disagree with. Emily asked: "So after you become this perfect person, what then?"  I didn't have an answer. I'm sure I fumbled around with my words and shared some half-truth to protect my fragility in that sensitive area. I had no idea.  But it started me on a journey to find out!

That same question popped up again later, when my friend Daniel Dennerkrans pointed out I seemed to be following such a *rational* career path, but I was sacrificing something *passionate* by giving up my art. Jürgen Salenbacher said the same thing around the same time. I again thought about the potted plant in the suit of armor.


### What did I want?

> "Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."

[Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer)

I couldn't decide because I could hardly feel the difference between one or the other. I decided the only way to find out, was to touch my feeling so I *could* feel what I wanted. I wanted to water the little plant in the armor and give it sunlight.

Two times this year I got the chance to help Hyper Island with its recruitment and training for new students. I was fortunate enough to work with an incredibly skilled and attentive team of people who cared so much for the mission and purpose of our school. I was and am still in awe of how present they were. From those experiences I learned bucketloads––about human behavior, about how working in a team *can be* an elevating and thrilling experience, and about myself and my own intuition. I have never been part of a process that caused grown men and women to cry because of how important our decisions felt to them. I would be a part of it again in a heartbeat––without pay or thanks––because of how meaningful that experience was. I hope I do get that chance.

Another experience that grew my potted plant three sizes came from my week at [UGL][ugl]. Much like the first week at Hyper Island, UGL is an education to experience. It is hard to describe, but it is explains the development of groups and leaders. However, the entire week was in Swedish, out in the countryside, with no exit. The isolation and my limitations in language opened roads to my emotions. I realized I did not need complicated words to get my point across. Sometimes I didn't use words at all. There was a moment after a touching video that tore open some old and new wounds all at once. I couldn't help myself but cry, violently, in a room of strangers. I had set out at the beginning of the week with the goal to get in touch with my emotions, expecting to learn what it felt like to be angry. I did not expect at all to feel as intensely sad as I did. But in that moment, the little boy Daniel stood up and told me to listen to him. That was why I had cried. So I listened.

From then I felt much more protective of that little boy. I vowed to keep his counsel, instead of the shoulds and musts of others. I hoped that with his help I could find and see the little children in others as well. And, even when it is hard sometimes, I try to speak with simple words and more meaning. Like Hemingway, the simple words feel most true. The potted plant had grown even more.

At the same time, I felt my concern for what others thought of me slacken its grip. The life I was "supposed to have" held much less weight, and in fact I did not want to comply in something I had no feeling for. My Christian religion too, has been a burden rather than a release, shackling my will to a way of being that only reinforced the armor but never tended to the little boy, or allowed him to feel sad or angry or afraid or disgusted. It was all rules to me, without fulfilling the promise it claimed. Maybe someday I will return and see it in a new light, but for now it does not hold me.

Still, the idea that freedom comes from discipline is not lost on me. I know that within boundaries we are much better at exercising freedom and autonomy and creativity. But what has changed is how I see discipline. It is not punishment, but practice. It is not hostile against the host, but against enemies when needed. Understanding and expressing emotions are an important kind of social martial art to understanding the soul.


### Ebb and flow

On my ride to Stockholm's airport, headed to Christmas in Colorado with my family where I am now, I felt angry. I felt frustrated because of how much of what I've learned this year that I felt I already lost. Things I experienced that were important to me, now gone, I couldn't recall. So I felt upset, and I cried. And after I was done, I felt a bit better, and also resolved. I want to cherish the things important to me, and not let them go just because all things return to dust. But I also see that I haven't lost those learnings––they are hibernating, like most things do in winter––they will bloom again in spring. They ebb and flow like the tide, and move like the phases of the moon. What I learned is now a part of me somewhere deeper, and I am living it subconsciously. The hard skills I learned? Those too are in there somewhere.

I am most proud of my emotional renaissance. The fact that I was angry on the train to begin with, and even moved to tears, I am closer to my feelings now than a year ago. And I now believe that the emotions are the roads to my soul, because of how much deeper the feeling is when sprung from true emotions instead of fabricated feelings. There is a big difference in feeling things than thinking them. Knowing and having both is important to me.

I think I am safe saying 2016 will hold some interesting moments, like 2015 did. After a week or so of reflection, I believe I have given time enough for my learnings to land and settle. 2016 will be the year of Heart.
