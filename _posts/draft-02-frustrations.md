Keep your attention on the small details, but force nothing. Let what isn't obvious be seen, and allow yourself to be moved by intuition.

Intuition, call it the spirit, genius, or daemon, runs naturally in the body the same way breathing does. But feelings and emotions are not the guiding spirit, but they are signals and shortcuts to reaching the heart of where intuition wants to lead you.

Lately, and by lately I mean the past 3 or so months, I have been feeling in a constant low-level state of stress and frustration that impedes my ability to think clearly and focus on work with the kind of accuracy and vigor I am used to giving. On the surface level, it might be that I am for the first time in my adult life working a social and professional workplace. Up until now, I have been working remotely and/or in small teams of extremely personal relationships. What used to come easily to me takes serious effort. The domain of expertise I used to enjoy (as a user experience designer) I no long have. The sense of authoritativeness and confidence I used to have over that domain is no longer there. In a new environment and unfamiliar work atmosphere with so many people around has me a bit befuddled from day to day. I would compare it to what a homeschooled kid must feel like coming to a public school for the first time. In addition, or as a result, I have also felt mental blockage around creating clear and concrete work that I feel like I can stand behind. My need to focus on a single task is frequently interrupted by people asking for my input, my freedom to share frank opinions is limited by my alleged ignorance of the landscape, and my ability to move out of ignorance into understanding is trapped by my difficulty finding focus. It is an attention-deficit loop, and it isn't working for me!

The TL;DR version is I feel I somehow contracted ADD.

My desire is to learn business and marketing strategy, and at the same time I want to conduct as many sessions and workshops as I can. There are two major hinders causing resistance: one is the torrential pour of new information that I *must read* in order to gain a better understanding; the other is the attention-deficit loop expanding my sense of overwhelm. I can get leverage in two areas, as I see it: one is to become rigorously focused on my goal, the other is to be radically candid about my boundaries and expectations so that I can manage my path.

Even more recently, as this frustration soup is coming to a simmer, I am recognizing how important it is to connect with people online and offline. Participation is key! It's the only way to get a sense of sanity. All of this mental input and very little output aside from on this diary is combustible. There needs to be in and out flow in the system.

Some communities I can explore, and projects I can work on:
- facilitation communities
- painting communities
- philosophy communities
- martial arts communities
- D&D community
