Who gets brainwashed, and why? In my experience, I've felt, thought, and believed that if the person I'm talking to is stubborn and unwilling to be open-minded then *they* must be brainwashed. If the person I'm talking to is not those things…well then maybe it's me. Point here is I believe we are all brainwashed. The question is *by whom?* What experiences, attitudes, and inputs have been filling up our minds to get us to believe what we believe?

I was talking with a friend the other day, whose name I will protect. He got really mad when telling me about his neighbor. Last week, he noticed bubbling in the wall of his brand-new apartment, indicating there was a water leak coming from the floor above him. He tried contacting his neighbor a hundred (probably not actually a hundred, but I don't know exactly how many) times to confront him on the issue. Mr. Neighbor never replied. After a week of ringing and swearing, the neighbor finally replied, saying "oh gosh, yeah apparently I had a leak I was going to tell you." My friend's explosive anger was of course a pretty natural response. Negligence like that gets expensive! The longer Mr. Neighbor waits to acknowledge his problem, the more damage it does to my friend's apartment.

There's a life lesson there alone: if something has gone wrong in *your world*, jump on it quick before you ruin an angry person's apartment.

But the part that surprised me, and the part I want to write about, was my friend's response. He turned vindictive, swearing all the way, "That jerk! I'm going to wreck my kitchen now." I asked "why?" He replied "So when the lawyers get the guy to pay for damages I'll get a remodeled kitchen."

Now I don't know if my friend will actually ruin his kitchen to get it remodeled. I believe he's on more stable ground than that. But it did get me thinking that there are some people who actually would do it to get more for themselves.

How does someone come to think of that as fair? That seems pretty exploitive. I asked him why he'd do that. His parents are lawyers, which I poked "well that explains your sense of morality!" He defended with humor, "Nah, I was raised by the interwebs, man. We were just kids!"

I jokingly asked him what if the Internet wrote the Bible? Not the Holy Bible, but its own set of moral codes on how to live well. We laughed about how contradictory it would be of itself. A billion people trying to agree on the right way to deal with bullies and women in video games gets more violent than most TV-dramas. Play 30 seconds of DOTA 2 and you will feel filthy *and* like a small, insignificant rodent.

I'm not Machiavellian by any stretch, but I notice that people become incredibly vicious to each other in the absence of morally sound input. No, I don't think that religion is the answer. But I do strongly believe that no matter what we do, our experiences will fill our heads with thoughts that will control our hands. This is one reason why people who are have a *lot* of different experiences are generally not brainwash-able. They've sorted out all the conflicting data by having a bunch of different inputs.

That same day, we talked about vices like tobacco and alcohol, smartphone addiction, and getting in schoolyard fights. Even though the conversation bounced around just for the pleasure of moving forward, a few little nuggets popped out. The thing is, some of us concluded, kids who get taught the skills of karate (for example) also get taught not to fight—to not abuse their power and ability. They get instilled with a sense of responsibility. I believe this applies not just to fist-fights and arguments, but everything else including sex, work, and health.

Everyone wants power. They want the ability to respond when harmed. It feels good to my soul to know that I *can* respond. And unless I (or you, or my friend, or a child) learn the skills I want to learn with moral application, I will learn the meaner kind by default. If I don't choose my inputs, then I will have my inputs chosen for me. It's the way things are.

We all get brainwashed. Wouldn't you want to choose what is washing your brain?
