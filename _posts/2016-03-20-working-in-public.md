I am opening my computer to the public.

All my digital work, I'm putting out there. Since I encourage companies and others to embrace transparency, I am practicing what I preach. All the projects, documents, budgets, journaling, inspiration, lists, and clutter are now free for anyone to see and comment on. By living out in the open, I hope I can show how easy and worthwhile it is to grow in plain sight, where people can see the process. So as much as I can, I am making my own inner workings open-source.

### Some disclaimers.

I've archived most things before October of 2015 because there would be too much clutter and redundancy otherwise. But if you want to sort through the archive and analyze my patterns and help me uncover some of my invisible scripts, you are welcome to.

Also I refuse to make public anything that involves other people. This is the private stuff like personal relationships and client work. Their trust is my priority. That is why anything with someone else's name is given confidentiality unless they have given me permission to share.

### Why am I doing this?

The short answer is because I want to encourage transparency and an open-source ideology. The long answer is, well, longer.

About half a year ago I came across [Undercurrent](http://www.undercurrent.com), a consulting company in New York that had closed its doors after a good run helping huge companies adopt transparent, agile ways of working. It had outlived its own shell, and so disbanded and reformed into a network of new companies and groups that I quickly started stalking. The most notable of the groups was [August](http://www.aug.co), whose bold mission to improve work involves making their *[whole company Google Drive](http://public.aug.co/)* open to the public. What!? How can a company go completely open source? SURELY the sales and finance and payroll should be kept private! Letting that sensitive stuff out would implode them, wouldn't it? Nope. The only thing you don't have access to is their client files, because they want to respect the privacy of those who hold their trust.

I was shocked and inspired, so I thought I would do the same. I have very little to lose (I don't make much yet, I'm not much of a target), and everything to learn. Why not?

I got inspired by reading [this transcript](https://medium.com/21st-century-organizational-development/the-future-of-organizations-is-responsive-5e2e9b5af16a#.y7j0vpegr) of a presentation given by Mike Arauz, founder of August. Mike's claim is that the world is accelerating into more uncertainty, and the people and organizations that will survive in the next century will be a part of open learning networks. The way to survive uncertainty is to be rapidly adaptive and learn quickly. The best way to thrive in uncertainty is to plug into a network and be transparent.

I'm imagining a not-so-distant future where practically all our information is online and accessible. Those who know how to handle themselves in that landscape will not only be safer than those who do not, but also more content because they are equipped to handle change. So I'm taking a step across the digital void to leap out and trust the network and the nature of learning.

If you read this, dig around my drive, and want to help me on any of my projects, please do. I welcome it. Feel free to comment, use, or remix anything I have. I take suggestions and feedback, because I'd love to get better as well.
