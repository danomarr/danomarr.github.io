I like starting. Something about stretching the wings makes the promise of flight feel a bit more exhilarating. It's exciting to think that "this time, when I work on something, it's going to matter, and people will praise me as a sage of the times, and I'll be listed on the Forbes 30 under 30, I know it." Dreams of grandeur. Although, I can't help but be totally in awe and inspired by the human guineapig Tim Ferriss and his jack-of-all-trades shamelessness. Angela Ahrendts, or Tony Hsieh, or Seth Godin, Josh Kaufman, Ramit Sethi, Tony Robbins, Ariana Huffington, Jeff Bezos, or Peter Diamandes. Today's Captains of Industry. (Well, the flashy marketing industry, anway) I am impressed, maybe even more, by the wily and entertaining Stephen West of Philosophize This! The amount of passion he pours into his work is really astonishing, and the output of his podcasts is nothing short of brilliant, from my humble perspective.

See but the truth is, I am overwhelmed by the sheer number of people out there doing really great work. I could spend all day, every day––and honestly, I have done this for a while now––consuming their delicious and satisfying work. Except, there is a limit to how much I can handle. It becomes too much for my brain. All this wonderful work gets crammed into my gluttonous brain and congests the system. Retreival is difficult at times, which triggers the thought "you must not know enough" and reinforced the cycle. So while I am inspired by so many wonderful inputs––and I didn't even list my creative or historical heroes––the flow in my input-output of my brain is out of balance. To borrow a manufacturing term, I have way too much inventory, but I'm not moving enough product out the door.

This business metaphor works, actually. Right now I'm a Strategy Intern at [B-Reel][b-reel] in Stockholm. I'm here because I want to learn the skills of understanding a business and how they make money, and how to help them improve their positioning. Seeing as most of my understanding around business and the like is theoretical, this internship is a great place for me to spread my wings and get some real knowledge. A business can have the most talented people and resources in the city, but without a goal it will still go out of business.

As part of my fumbling around until I get a grip on the definitions of strategy and principles of business, I am reading Josh Kaufman's [Personal MBA][pmba]––as good a book as I've come across that breaks down everything I've ever wanted to know about business. Josh describes a business as having [5 essential parts][pmba-5parts].

> Roughly defined, a business is a repeatable process that:
>
>1. Creates and delivers something of value...
>2. That other people want or need...
>3. At a price they’re willing to pay...
>4. In a way that satisfies the customer’s needs and expectations...
>5. So that the business brings in sufficient profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

Now, a human being's life doesn't follow the same sequence by the letter, but the professional part of that person *does*, and both a business and a person thrive much better when these 5 parts are balanced and true. So for that reason, it is important to adopt the habits of a healthy and thriving business, if that's what's making the world tick. 

It's impressive to me how many businesses out there are doing this so well. All of the heroes I listed above are stars and running their machines in a way that makes others really happy. That's nice. Life is a little bit better for some people because of the contributions of Seth Godin and Stephen West.

Any of us has the chance to do the same. I sure do, anyway. There is an abundance of talent, resources, and possibilities to make some really wonderful things and make other people very happy. It just needs a CEO with a product he wants to push out there and some shameless curiosity.
