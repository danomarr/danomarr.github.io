In many ways, there is something to be said for learning about oneself. When introspective, it can be either notably insightful, or when making mistakes can be extremely frustrating. In the last twelve months, I have experienced the gamot. Fortunately for me, I took to journaling on a relatively consistent basis–––enough to fill four books anyway––and decided to take my own personal development and life-education adamantly. Now, a year into it, I have everything available for my own reflection. In the past year I was fortunate enough to encounter a slew of wonderfully engaging and inspiring sources of learning: BigIDEAS from TVO in Ontario, Canada (podcast), TED talks (online), TTC History of World Literature (audio series http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=2300), Academic Earth (online), StumbleUpon, Freakonomics by Stephen Levitt and Stephen Dubner, Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston, A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz, The Contrarians' Guide to Leadership by Stephen Sample, The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, Outliers by Malcom Gladwell, The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho, As A Man Thinketh, by James Allen, How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. Enlightening experiences too, have shaped my year.  A  solo trip to New Zealand, my third year of college at the University of Southern California and more ////.

If a universal concept can be extracted from the past year, I would identify it as the "Synchronicity of manifested Reality through Supraconscious and Subconscious thought as related to the propensities of Human Behavior and modalities of Being." That would be my academic labeling of my realization.  In a simpler explanation: I am now at least slightly aware of both the "Law of Attraction" and the "Nature of Duality," and how they relate to one another. I cannot by any means claim that I understand them, but I will attempt to articulate my experience in them.

0 and 1; or, How Duality Is Unity, and Unity makes Life Possible and Inevitable

I am not a philosopher, nor by any stretch of imagination any kind of academic or qualified authority on the subject of metaphysics or other theoretical literature written by the greatest contemplative minds to have walked the earth. I am just a student of Life, and I aspire to articulate my own contemplations and experiences that they might be shared.

"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.  Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness."

In the first verse we are introduced to the simplest reality of existence. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Dissecting it word by word, "in" is used instead of "at"; there is no punctuation separating thoughts etc. The verse is incredibly multifaceted and dynamic in its subtlety. It identifies  the nature of this "created existence" as dualistic.

Something about water...

The first duality is void, and the second is Light.

There is considerable interest to be noted in God's separation of Light and dark. While the archaic knowledge that darkness equalled Night and lightness was Day might be considered obvious and not exactly revelatory, it reveals a profundity that we oversee often.

Without delving too deeply into the esoterica of it all, balance is, and always has been, the foundation for life. In our personal lives, and as it relates to humanity as a whole, balance is inevitable at a macrocosmic level–––yet in the personal life of a man he can determine his own happiness with a series of revelations in his cache.

The omnipresent power in today's world is as obviously confronting to our nature as humans as the night sky was before cities and electricity. In fact, as many academics have noted, technology has allowed us to comfortably remove ourselves from being confronted by the wonders of nature and the vastness of the infinite. Yet, it should be known that the very basis of technology is founded on the same principles of duality that rule the universe. For example, a circuit board is a series of "on-off" signals sent by a switchboard. It has evolved into binary code in computing, 1 being "on" and 0 being "off."

So what on earth have I learned??

I have no freaking clue.

Something about balance. Sometime's I'm on. Sometimes off. It's a process, and I'll get better at finishing up this thought. it might be a while.

The realization itself was merely an experience and awakening of perception that IT IS OK TO SOMETIMES BE OFF, especially as EVERYTHING is in constant duality.  Sometimes you are inspired, other times not. This is the way it is. Energy must be consumed in order to be produced. The trick is to allow for minimal wasting of energy (sins), to spend it in creating energy or consuming it in balance. But even that is sometimes off.

It's like that one statistic: 1/3 options is correct, meaning that if you choose either of the other 2, they too have a probability of 1/3.

Fractals too. Micro and macrocosms are all interrelated. Another example of balance and extrapolation.

Perhaps I'll revisit this in more of the fashion that I wrote it in my Moleskin. SImply and succinctly, without any need for some lengthy dissertation.

Cheers.
