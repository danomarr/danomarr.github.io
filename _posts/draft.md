In order to make a difference, sometimes all it takes is being present enough to notice something small, the gap between tears and shutters of breath to find a glimmer of light. We are all looking for a little hope, and a friend who can help us see ourselves as valuable.

Today I met with my friend and fellow strategist Lina, and we got to talking about advertising, organizational culture, workshops, and of course philosophy——as we usually do. After a tumble of wailing at the insensitivity of the large machines that milk us for our authentic perspectives and hopes to change the global discussion, we affirmed ourselves that it is up to us to make small changes with small goals. That is the only manageable way——it really is impossible to learn everything at once.  

At some point the conversation turned private and tender.
