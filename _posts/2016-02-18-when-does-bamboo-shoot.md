Do you know how they grow bamboo trees? They plant a seed, fertilize and water it all year. Nothing grows. Year two they fertilize and water it all year. Nothing grows. Year three they fertilize and water it all year. Nothing grows. Year four they fertilize and water it all year. Nothing grows. Year five, they fertilize and water it. Boom! The bamboo shoots up 90 feet in its fifth year. This is Ziglar's parable for what it takes to succeed. There is no payoff for a long, long, time…but in the end, the growth is explosive.

So too with us, if we choose to develop the obvious, simple fundamental skills of bringing our best out of ourselves and each other.

What skills are those?

Zig Ziglar, if you haven't heard the man, is a whirling storm of positive power and Texas enthusiasm you simply don't see anymore. Could be because he is literally from another generation, sure, he was born and raised in Mississippi in the golden years of America's heyday. He professed some outdated and also some traditional beliefs. But Zig Ziglar, grandfather of the motivational speakers like Tony Robbins and ancestor to my role model of today, Seth Godin, was a rare breed of human. He is so good, I have to give him a few more listens. Maybe even 17, like he suggests. But even after a single day of listening, I can tell that my own enthusiasm, self-talk, and determination are bolstering.

Ziglar, aside from his masterful communication skill as a storyteller and entertainer (I haven't laughed so much all winter), is exceptionally good at pointing out the obvious. The thing is, most of the time I'm blind to the obvious, so I need someone like him to point it out to me!

What's obvious is that you don't need some master vision dotted out to the letter and breath in order to get started. What is needed is the commitment to develop the skills of success. It isn't rocket science, and it isn't magical. But determination, honesty, integrity, consistency, sincerity, punctuality, gratitude, enthusiasm and a handful of other skills (not attitudes!)—which I'm still learning on a first name basis—are what it takes to succeed. The reason they're not attitudes is because they can grow and they can atrophy. The only way they change is depending on their use. Cultivate the fundamental skills and reap the benefits.
