Being completely fair, this review didn't occur at the end of 2011, but the end of 2012. Interestingly, during that period of time I was caught up in a highly demanding relationship. The relationship began in June of 2011 and lasted into March of 2012.

Seeing as 2011 was the year of discipleship/discipline, it's interesting to see how it did and did not manifest in my life. By that measure, I have a few stories worth telling as I revisit the activities and explorations of 2011.

Connecting with people takes commitment, emotion, and skill.

I remember I was sitting with Eric and Clifton one morning at Starbucks. I sensed I was on the verge of some abstract epiphany about life. Whatever insight I'd almost had, I don't remember. It was most likely another one of my philosophical assertions sprung from my knack for personal-development thinking. At the time, it still needed to be fully captured. I was very eager to find it, so I talked around the point until I had it figured out. And while I wandered around a nebulous topic that had started with so much excitement, I watched their eyes glass over as I lost my way in the brambles of convoluted and purposeless thinking.

My friends had totally tuned me out.

"But I love talking about this stuff! Why don't they care?" I felt disappointed and frustrated I couldn't share my enthusiasm for life with people the way I experience it.

So I decided then that something was amiss. I did my best to stop rambling. I read a book called Make Your Point! (at Clifton's suggestion). I became an intense listener and consequently a quiet person. Meanwhile, my relationship with Jennifer was souring, and I became more and more internal, keeping silent since I'd learned I didn't have a point to make most of the time I opened my mouth. At Mastermind, Clifton seemed much more calculated, and Eric more natural. But it wasn't just with those two. It was with most everyone.

> Jennifer, was gregarious and relatable.
(ex. wine party @ my house, pool birthday party)

> Marcus, exciting and fun to be around.
(ex. telling stories of experience on Railroad Revival)

> Madison, comfortable and opinionated.
(ex. talking about drunk high-dive at SC)

> Matt, funny and very relaxed.
(ex. at the bar talking to the women from Iowa)

> Even my brother Kevin, charismatic and independent.
(ex. telling story about chasing dog after lacrosse)

And in reality, all those things are true. They ARE those things. They're good socializers---they can tell stories that are compelling and interesting. They're good at having fun in their own way. They make people feel good.

The solution, I decided, is in telling stories. LOTS of stories.

I realized this in all its fullness by watching Ramit Sethi one afternoon.  I was alone in front of my computer watching one of his classes, and taking notes on all the principles and tactics he was dropping. Personally, as a guy who hoards lists of advice and principles for living like a prospector panhandling for gold, I was stashing notes like a true Colorado gold-digger. Ramit was making it rain!

Ramit was sharing a story of the experience from one of his students. I realized that while I was eating up the facts, I was getting convinved by the stories, and yet I was only capturing the information presented, not the story.

Information without context is just data. It depends completely on the person taking the info in to organize and digest it to make it meaningful.
Information WITH context has meaning. It's presented in a digestible way and can have an impact.

FOR EXAMPLE...You can think of it quite literally like the difference between going to a salad bar and eating the cooking of a skilled chef. Which is a better experience?

In Sweden, my Morfar made us a meal. As an appetizer, he prepared canteloupe with prosciutto and basil. I'd never even heard of this combination of foods, much less known what to expect.  Like a good Swede, he is an absurdly particular man, and has an obsession for doing things the proper way. Each garnish was beautifully decorated, each melon cut perfectly and balanced with a fine sliver of salty prosciutto ham. It was an artwork. From the moment I saw it, I was intrigued. And now this beautifully prepared food was served to me, with attention and care. Morfar was cheerful as only a chef can be in his element. I was excited to eat this strange and foreign idea.

His appetizer was sensational. I'd never thought that combination of flavors could be so profound. It not only tasted good, it gave me a fond memory and made enough of an impact on me to add it to my own recipe book. Now I share that appetizer with others from time to time.

The point of an appetizer: to tease the palatte. (Get the eater hungry and excited to eat!) It takes a lot of experience and effort to become a good cook, but when it's done really well it becomes a memorable experience that someone (or many) will love. It's the same with a well-told story. It's the experience that makes it stick.

So that's why I'm making an effort to get better at being an active storyteller. In order to do so, experiences must be had and shared in a way that's worth listening to!  Because from my perspective, that is one of the areas I believe I should be good in, and I'm not quite there yet.

Why does that matter to me? Well, I've obviously got a lot of raw data I've piled up that I'd like to share with people. Problem is, not a lot of it has stuck for me (lack of related experiences) and consequently that makes it tough to share with others.
