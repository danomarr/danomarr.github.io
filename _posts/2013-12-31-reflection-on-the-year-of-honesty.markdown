#### What I learned in 2013

- The same things crop up and repeatedly return. Principles outweigh methods.
- There are universal truths, nuance is important for sake of harmony
- The Grocery Aisle Principle (Ben Hartard)
- The Most Important Person in the World Principle (Bill the Bookkeeper)
- The Right Question Principle
- DiSSS : Deconstruct, Select, Sequence, Stakes
- CaFE : Capture, Frequency, Encode
- Read what is immediately relevant / or elevates the present mind
- To write every morning (3 pages, always...and let whatever comes to mind be what I write).
- Top performers have a bias towards action/experimentation
- Hang out with the people who are already how you want to be (Ramit's Meetup, CO kids)
- Stuffing my brain with distractions is a depressing way to live, ergo:
- I earnestly, desperately need God in my life to anchor me beyond the whims of my changing temperament
