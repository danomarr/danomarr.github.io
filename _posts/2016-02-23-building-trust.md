Now more than ever, attention and trust are the most valuable things anyone has. Of course our world still runs on money. But the kings of the Google kingdom aren't grubbing for more money, they're hard at work finding ways to live forever. Today there are more options for what you have to offer than ever before. People will toss out what they dislike right away. With Tinder, a million matches are only a swipe away. If this one isn't the real deal, toss it. Get another.

For some, people are expendable. They hope that "the next one will be better," oblivious to their own participation in the system.

They will find something or someone new to put their hope in, ignoring everything else. Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders? For many people, one of these is very real, and the other is completely fake.

People hope in what they want. People want more of what they trust.

In an attention-starved world, anesthetized by Tinder and Trump, it is possible to stand out by building trust and earning attention the old-fashioned way: taking care of people, one at a time.

You get attention by helping someone. You build trust by continuing to help, give, and share.
