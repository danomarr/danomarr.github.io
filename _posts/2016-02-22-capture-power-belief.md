The power of belief is much stronger than the power of logic. Fortunately, it is possible to choose what to believe through the thoughts that lead to emotion. For the longest time I lacked belief in myself. Today, I can say with confidence that I have full belief in my abilities and my potential. There is boundless amounts of energy inside of me, and you for that matter, that *wants* to come out in its own form of music. Letting it out might be scary, and as I'm getting the tuning right, I'm noticing the effect on others: looking at me a little strange and even with trepidation. "He's acting different, what has changed?" There's some pep in my step, some gusto in my gut. It feels good to wake up, even after a poor night's sleep because there are so many things to do today. I am grateful for the opportunity to get up and move around and think and write and draw and workâ€”it's a dream.

Everything feels totally different after this weekend of looking myself in the eye in the mirror and saying I'm a man of high moral character, determination, enthusiasm, humor, high intellect and high emotion, and other important values I chose for myself, *because they are what I really want for myself.* This is opposed to when I used to do similar things about four years ago because I thought they would bring me career success and recognition for "figuring life out". Then, I wanted glory. Now, I want integrity. The shift is subtle but the difference is huge.

Today, I say these things and I believe them. And even as I know that some of them aren't all the way true (yet), being honest makes me want to correct the discrepancy. And I'm not going to drop the bar on what I want, so instead the behaviors are what change. For example, in the mornings I claim "I love learning. I try new (and sometimes scary things) all the time." And I'd be a hypocrite if I backed down from a new opportunity that got me feeling nervous because I didn't know what would happen. So this morning, with my girlfriend just returned from a ski trip, I got pumped up to continue my morning routine saying these beliefs to my face. I knew she'd think I'd gone crazy, but I was determined to go through with them, even though she might disbelieve in me or think I was off my nut, maybe even mock me right in the middle of it. I was actually nervous to do this with her around. (So of course, I waited until she went to the bathroom.) Small but important achievement!

I play the long game, and the trick to affecting change in any shape is to play the long game with consistency. I expect that there will be some resistance in the beginning. I've heard that is typically the case with change. I've been experiencing the Resistance to change myself for several years now and *finally* I feel like it's clicked for me.

A shorthand formula, by no account perfect, if you're reading this and you also want it to *click* (in this order):

- Capture the desire to change
- Try new things all the time
- Share generously with people you care about
- Consistently keep a journal (or blog)
- Practice thinking for yourself
- Listen to audiobooks about personal mastery
- Read all the time

It's ordered this way because one thing leads to the next. If you want to change, you need to try new things. Skipping straight to reading is cheating if you do that already. If you try new things all the time, share the good stuff generously with stories, art, or whatever. Share. If you want to do that successfully, you probably need to keep a journal of things, so your memory and communication skills improve. If you want to do that, you will need to start thinking independently. And if you want to think independently you need new inputs: which come in the form of audio and visual reading. Get new ideas and get new thoughts. Get new thoughts and you have some individual thinking. With individual thinking you can communicate new ideas and fresh perspectives. With new ideas and fresh perspectives you can share better stuff. With better stuff you can have more new experiences, and with new experiences you will capture the change you seek.

So start by capturing the desire to change and go.
