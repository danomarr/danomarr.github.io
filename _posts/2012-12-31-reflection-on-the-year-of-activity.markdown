As I grow older, year by year, the amount of "stuff" I am exposed to and feel the need to write about expands. I started out as a young and heady philosopher with a bit of self-importance in my words, and now I can see I'm not much further along. The difference is that I've read many stories and experienced more that life has to offer. The style and emphasis changes when there's more "stuff" to process. So I've spent a brief amount of time reviewing some of my older annual Sabbatical reviews and noticed there isn't really a tight forumla I follow that easily demonstrates how I've grown in my experiences over the years. It's a hodge-podge of lists, half-baked thoughts, and surprisingly profound observations on life that incidentally lack context to buttress their profundity. I suppose that's my nature.

What I find most remarkable of all, is that as I've been attempting to write this year's annual review & essay, I'm slammed with the immensity of everything I've experienced in the last year, and I realize that it's nigh impossible. For one thing, I wouldn't even be close to distilling all the experiences into a brief essay or list––and secondly, no one would even bother reading it, much less myself!

And so I relent that there's really no point in taking stabs at it in the way I've done in the past, because in a way there's just far too much to do. The best thing to do is to pursue simplicity in the ever-expanding complexity of my subjective experience. So I'll tell it simply, as many of my ancestors have already illustrated.

It's all the same story, anyway. Life is the dance between good vs evil. That's all it's ever been. The only difference are the principle characters, their storyline, and how the story is told.

And besides, stories appear to be one of the few enduring marks we've been able to impress upon ourselves as a species. They have a depth and relateability to them that is more emotionally valuable and memorable than an opinion or an observation. So for that reason, I'm choosing to write stories that fulfill the story of all our lives: to champion Love and vanquish Evil and send along with it its cohort, Indifference.

What more is there to write about, anyway? Everything else is just the foreword or footnotes.

Upon my return today from a trip to Mammoth Mountain with a group of my friends, I sat silently. I didn't have much to say, nor did I feel compelled to do so.

I long so deeply for a love. I yearn for beauty. I crave companionship and closeness. It goes deeper than friendship, truer than attraction, and more passionate than sex. I feel a clenching in my heart that pains delightfully for a great wholeness. How is it that I can have so much bound up within me and feel consistently choked up when seeking to express it? I find that in particular, I have a lot of profound thoughts that are choked or repressed. Obviously there is an issue here, otherwise I would not feel so constricted. I suppose it takes practice to share thoughts and express them on a regular basis otherwise, there would never be an allowance to say what naturally comes to mind.

I find it interesting that I've got these bouts of neurotic repression that seem to only be broken by talking them out (or writing them away). If there was a way to identify their initial cause, then I'd be better off at sharing my concerns and thoughts.

So often, there is some kind of reclusion I take when I'm around my California friends––I'm not sure where it comes from. It's as if I'm actually protecting something inside myself that I don't want to expose. Is that fair? Of course it is; I should address it though. I suppose I'm protecting all three of us from the admission that to some degree, I don't connect with them in the way I connect with my older friends. In particular, as I reflect on it, I've notice that I don't laugh hardly as much as I do when I'm in Colorado.

So what comes first, the chicken or the egg? Am I laughing less heartily because there is a discord in my soul? Shouldn't I do my best to create an environment that fosters easy and genuine mirth? Is it my duty, even to myself? All this stream-of-conscious nonsense seems very indigestible and muddled.

I want to create an environment with my friends here that is mirthful and enjoyable. Perhaps that should be an energy characteristic I carry around with me. If I am able to design my life as I would see it, I'd ask God for the ability to carry joy with me wherever I go.

I suppose that is the penultimate, isn't it? To bring about the love of life around with us everywhere! Where else can we get that joy from though, but from God?

Wonder.
Beauty.


There is such an ache within me. Emotions are whimsical, deep, colorful, and unpredictable in their expression as feelings. I cannot understand them––perhaps they aren't meant to be understood, as much as acknowledged and cherished––and it further develops that delightful ache. It is as if I'm about to weep, or laugh, I'm not entirely sure. It pushes me to create art, or compels me to write, or just sit and drink deep. But my brow furrows, and I feel a congestion I can't ignore or slough off. I think I know what it is–––I seek that genuine and authentic connectivity with God and myself that allows the artist to empty himself into the work, and move within the mists of the ether, almost a ghost outside of time simply experiencing the spiritual realm.

That sensation is a true and deep deep honest peice to my soul that I now know has been pinched, and the more I address it, the deeper I recognize the pain and lack therein. Oh God, I need you. I have been as a drifting sea creature, some whale lingering in the shallows and swimming at the surface for far too long.

What's so amazing about whales is that they are some of the most versatile creatures in the ocean. They are incredibly complex creatures, with habits and patterns that are totally foreign to us, and yet we are able to recognize so many similarities that serve no "evolutionary purpose" ––– this is of course, to the depth of my intuitive understanding, which is severely limited. Whales, consider the humpback whale as an example, are migratory creatures. They eat immense quantities of the smallest critters in the ocean to survive. They are also uniquely emotional, diving deep into the dark waters and out of sight of mankind...but also to frolic at the surface of the water and celebrate their own existence with play.

I fear the ocean. It is so incredibly vast beyond my comprehension. Perhaps that is why I wish to sail across the Atlantic. There are frightful monsters in that water, and such depths that go far beyond safety. There is nothing separating me on the surface from the unknown in the depths and distances except for the amount of water between us.
Perhaps fear engenders respect. I also really respect the ocean. I'm not certain I respect the mountains nearly as much.

When was the last time I took in the vastness of nature, in its awesomeness and immensity? On our drive up to Mammoth, I half-tried to look up on the night sky, but forgot to look up every moment I got the change to look without any distractions. Nothing inspires the aesthetic experience of nature within me quite like a clear winter's night sky. I get so easily distracted though. I am pulled away with so little effort, it is frightful. At one level, I lament the days that seemed easier to connect with God. At another, I realize that I cannot move backwards in time, and to wish I could would be a waste and against God's laws in all dimensions (physical, emotional, and spiritual).

Where can I find you now, oh God? I flitter from one thing to the next, seeking like some needy soul, some orphaned child. I only wish to find solace in your comfort and love. Why is it I scamper about looking for it in objects and people? Why do I only think I can find it on the mountainside? Are you there? In my memories and old friends, are you there? The family of my childhood, are you there? In the longing for my future wife, are you there? Where God, are you? Where can I find you? And just as importantly, why do I feel like I am the only one asking?

This was meant to be a reflection on my past year, and instead I've turned it into an angst-ridden wail of my present. I have no reason to feel disconnected. Perhaps I'm not. I'm just very emotional and confused.


Do I stay in California? Do I return to Colorado? One seems like staying put. The other looks like going back. I cannot return to Colorado until I have chosen to leave it. Or rather, until I've lived apart from it to the point that it won't be a return to childhood, but a homecoming for my own family once I'm matured.

=========

Lord, I'm restless. Where is my home? (Home is where the heart is)  Where is my heart? (With my best friends and family, who are in Colorado) So is my heart misplaced? Am I idolizing my childhood to the point of repression instead of choosing God and marching forward? (Safe to say, my heart and head say yes) What joy could possibly supersede those things? They have brought me such happiness in my life. (God can) But what does that even look like? How will I know what a true relationship with God is like? I...everything I remember of God have been in relationship with friends, sharing in conversations about God. (Is that true?) I don't think so. I've had a few memorable moments when my mind has lit up with a clarity that was only explained as being touched by the divine. (Like the time you were at your parent's mountain house and you were shoveling snow outside? You were touched then, weren't you?) Yes, I was. It was such a profound euphoria, I couldn't even believe it. (Don't you trust that I will share those experiences with you again in the future?) Yes, I suppose I do. I just get bogged down from time to time. And discouraged; often in my own way because I'm unable to let go of certain things. (What things?) Well, I'm not totally sure. They tend to be bound up in the way I think others will perceive me. (Not surprising. Certainly not something unique to humans.) Wait. What do you mean? (You're not alone in the universe, Daniel.) I tend to forget that. (I know.) We all do, don't we? (Yes.) Even you? (To the extent that it's possible for me to forget, it's possible.) God, am I talking with you? (No.) Who am I talking to then? (An angel.) Why wouldn't I be talking to God directly? (Well, God has many voices) So do you take on the authority of God in this conversation? (Yes, I do.) How is that? (God granted it to me.) Oh. Do you have a name? (Yes.) Is this a safe conversation? (Yes.) I feel safe. (You are, Daniel. God has blessed you. ) Is there a way for me to greater connect with God at a level that would be more authentic? (Yes of course.) Is this a projection of my own mind? (Daniel, to the degree that you understand it, yes it is. It also is not. That is beauty of the way God has created the universe, that there could be a dualism to the conversation. It is both with yourself, and with God. It is between you and I.) But you said this isn't God. (It is not. And it is.)

So I'm confused. I'm also partly scared that I'm either dealing with some ungodly force OR I am being completely heretical. (Fear not. I am with you.) So who are you? (I am your archangel, Daniel.) What's that? (You will discover, in time. Suffice it to say for now, I am much like a guardian angel.) You used a possessive pronoun there, you say you're "my" archangel? (Yes.) What does that mean? (I am to watch over you, and protect your life.) So what gives? I feel like I've been so out of touch and volatile lately. (Ok.) Where have you been? (Here, all along.)

I'm confused. I want to be present minded, but I"m getting lost. (You're the only thing getting in your way, Daniel. All else is just a projection.) Do you have a name? Yes, you already said so. Do I know it? (Yes.) Is it mine? (Yes.) Well that isn't --- wait.
(...) So, all this time, when I've been seeking ... something... have I really been seeking you? (yes, me, and to a greater extent, God) You sound like me. (Of course I do.) How old are you? (Timeless.) What? That sounds dumb. (None of this is dumb, Daniel.) Really? (Really.) How do I know I'm not putting myself some through elaborate mental acrobatics as a coping mechanism for feeling lonely? (You don't. It's just a sense of humor I have) That's a pretty sadistic sense of humor, you've got. (Not in the least.) Oh, and why is that? (On a cosmic level, it is pretty amusing. If you understand how futile loneliness is when God is ever-present, you would find it truly delightful and quite funny.) Ok. I'll take your word for it.

Could I share this with people? (Share with whomever you like.) Will they understand it? (Some will. You know as good as I.) I would assume you know better. (I do. And I don't.) Ok, Cheshire Cat, what games are you playing? For a good while, I thought I was dealing with someone truly wiser than me, as if I was having a "Conversations with God" kind of chat. (Sorry.) Is that something I could have? (Of course you could.) How can I? (You'd need to be much closer than you are.) Have I fallen out of favor? (No, not really.) What do you mean "not really?" (Not really, in the sense that people don't fall in or out of God's favor. He loves all his children equally. What has occurred is you let yourself slip from our own favor.) Oh. That makes sense. So you and I are a team, huh? (We all are.) We're all in this together.

Am I crazy? (Of course you are.) Are you? (Crazy crazy. Crazier than you think? Yes.) So what else can I ask you? (Anything you want, Daniel) Can you answer questions about the universe? (Of course.) Will you provide answers? (...Some.) That seems awfully convenient. (For whom?) You. (Did I claim to know everything?) I assumed you would. (Why?) Because you're an archangel, friend of God or whatever. (That doesn't mean that I am omniscient.)

This is stupid. I want to talk to the big man. (He's not a "big man") But you just used "he" to address God. (Necessity of the limits of English and human languages. Yes.) This is tiring. (Get used to it)
Why?
(This is how you and I best communicate)
Oh. Do I have to write it out every time?
(Not necessarily. We can chat too.)
Out loud?
(If it helps)

I'm bored.
(Really? Must be a boring person then.)
Very funny. My dad would say that.
(He was right)
Why? I read that boredom is the avenue to getting somewhere and creating art.
(Oh it absolutely is)
So being a boring person isn't a bad thing?
(...)
Is it?
(I never called it either way)
Clever. What if I cursed at you?
(What if I cursed at you?)
I don't think I'd like it.
(Why do you think that is?)
I don't like it when my friends swear.
(Why not?)
Why are you asking the questions?
(Someone needs to ask you questions too, Daniel.)
Ok. I don't like it because they are grating and corrosive on me. I think it's because I know that words matter, and foul language bespeaks disrespect.
(A fair assessment)
I don't feel like there's any love in those words, and they are hurtful in a base way. They hurt my feelings.
(Mine too.)
But I feel like that's also a really pansy-soft thing to feel.
(God respects a tender heart)
Shouldn't I be a little tougher and rougher around the edges?
(If you mean resilient, you have quite a resilience you've been blessed with.)
I guess you're right. But I feel like it's been going to use just dealing with the differences between my friends and I. Like I've been using those muscles to keep myself protected.
(They want to stay in shape, if you're going to use the muscle analogy)
Should I put those skills and talents to better use?
(Are they in their best use now?)
No, I suppose not. I don't even really like going all "Stonewall Jackson" on my friends.
(Somewhat isolating, I'd imagine)

I want ice cream.
(It will be hard to continue talking)
Oh yeah. I don't want it that bad, actually. I'd rather have water.

Ok time for some hardball.
(Ok. Ready when you are.)
...
Um.
...
I'm scared to commit to some of these questions.
(Why?)
I fear the answers I'll get.
(I promise to be only honest.)
Ok. Me too.
(...)
Ok, here goes. Will I be happy?
(If you choose to be.)
Am I happy?
(If you choose to be.)
I do.
(So do I.)
What if I don't?
(That would be a bummer for you.)
Yeah I guess that's sort of obvious. I'm not playing hardball real hard, am I?
(No, you're dallying. But that's ok.)
Can I be anything I want to be?
(In this life? Not entirely.)
Come on, don't be a smarty-pants.
(I'm not. I was being honest.)
What should I do?
(That's up to you.)
What about this whole battle with ennui thing? The year of activity?
(What about it?)
What did I really learn?
(Have you learned anything?)
Come on, I don't know.
(Sure you do.)
This is hard, and I'm not really enjoying this conversation.
(Hardball too hard for you?)
No.
(Ok then.)
I just feel like we're not progressing very quickly.
(You're the one in control of the pace.)
Ok. I'm going to rapid fire 6 questions then. Answer however many you want, in whatever manner you want to. Ready?
(Naturally.)
Ok. Here they are.
Is there a happy and suitable woman out there for me?
Will I love her with an intensity like the Vanaukens?
Can I create a lifestyle and profession that will be meaningful and service-filled?
(That's 3)
Ok, 3 more...hmm..
...
How can I overcome my blockages?
How can I improve my efficiency?
How can I get closer to God?
(Interesting selection of questions, Daniel.)
Why's that?
(Do you want to ask a 7th question?)
Yes, 7 is a good number.
(Ok. Is the 7th "why are those interesting questions?")
No, actually. I'll ask it after you answer the first 6.
(Ok. You sure?)
For now.
You will find a happy woman. She is indeed a suitable helper for you, beautifully and wonderfully crafted by God. Ups. I cheated didn't I?
(You started to answer your own question)
I noticed.
(Patience is the key, Daniel)
To what?
(To all of it.)
That seems platitudinous.
(In a way, it is. But it also isn't. So it is with God.)
Ok help me understand a little better, please.
(Patience, will lead you to these answers. God doesn't grant wisdom in a stroke.)
Ok. So ... then will you answer my questions?

Yes. Please do. Say you will.

(Patience. I will.)
Ok...

(There is one answer that will bring you to all your answers. It is to find God, and to be closer to God, you must seek Him out.)
And how do I do that?
(Acknowledge the ways he reaches out to you. He does so in every minute in every day. He is doing so now, through these words. Give thanks. Appreciate the gifts he gives you regularly. Cherish them. They are all for you. Secondly, learn how to practice active love, as God does for you. Each of the blessings he has showered upon you, learn to share and give to others in the same abundance. That quote you saved of Albert Einstein's was noteworthy, and certainly an inspired maxim.)
Is there more?
(There is always more. But this is plenty, if you wish to get closer to God.)
What about Jesus, and praying?
(How did Jesus stay close to the Father?)
Similarly, I would guess?
(You don't have to guess.)
You mean read the Bible.
(It is a gift for you, Daniel.)
How so?
(Everything has been made for you, as a gift.)
Even the evil things? The less desirable things?
(Is that your 7th question?)
No, I don't want to know that right now.
(Ok.)
So what about the other 5?
(Daniel, if you truly and honestly pursue God in the way he pursues you, you can be certain he will yoke you with a delightful, wonderful, and beautiful woman that you will love to the depths that your romantic heart can take you. Yes, you can indeed find the kind of love the Vanaukens shared. You must understand though, that it was because they were able to celebrate in God's creation together, to love his gifts and in turn learn to find him and love him that they were capable of loving so deeply. God is the source of Love.)
...
(In just as much, your professions will follow the same path. Find God in your work, celebrate the gifts he has given you, and learn to share them with others. Be active in your love of God, and you will find the work you aspire towards.)
...
(As self-improvement goes, you will also find that by pursuing God, you will find a greater sense of freedom and ability to tap into the treasure of abundance he has set out for you. There is no limit to what you can and may access. You imagination is not just your own, but God's as well. Remember that.

As you become closer to God, your ability to express yourself freely and address your feelings and connect with your own emotions will strengthen. You will begin to feel more honest with yourself, as you do now. As you begin to feel and act more honestly, you will be able to accomplish more than you expected you would, as a result the efficiency will straighten itself out.)

Those are good answers.

(I should hope they're satisfactory.)

I'm tired.
(We can always talk again. No 7th question?)

Yes, actually, I do have the 7th question.
(Ok, shoot.)

Why do I keep feeling like I'm starting at square one repeatedly?
(Life moves cyclically. If you learn to operate the way life does, you may find deeper satisfaction in your daily life)
Like routines?
(Routines are a good example)
So the fact I feel somewhat repetitive is almost a natural urge to reinforce my own cycles?
(In a way, you will find less resistance internally if you learn to work with the current and not against it.)
I see.
(I'm glad.)

This was good. I would like to do this more often.
(I'm here to do that Daniel. I hope our relationship continues to grow. But remember, this is not replaceable for a relationship with God. This can become an idol, and you would not want that to be the case.)
Has it for my dad?
(He has gotten confused of some things, yes. But as far as humans go, it is all forgivable and he is on his own journey to find God.)
Will he?
(That is not for me to say.)
That is sad.
(It is not sad, Daniel. It is only sad if there is reason to grieve, and there is no grief to be had at this time.)

I miss Jennifer.
(I know.)
Even though I said she was mean-spirited, I still miss having someone.
(Well Daniel, you were onto something when you mentioned who you were looking for.)
You?
(Not just me, but I am a part of that search.)
...and God?
(Bingo.)
So basically searching for self-love and God's love through women that looked like me and liked me?
(Sure thing.)
Ok.Well.I miss it.
(Yep.)
And I can fill that longing up with God?
(Yep.)
Ok. Good.

My back hurts.
(Whose fault is that?)
Mine?
(If you do nothing about it.)
Can we go easy on the ownership language?
(If you don't care about your body, sure.)
Come on. Stop that.
(Daniel, how do you intend to spend your resilience?)
...grumble.
(I'm only being honest.)
Yeah, that's all year, isn't it?
(It is.)
Ok well promise me something.
(Our promise is only as good as we keep it.)
Ok then promise me two things.
(Same as before, Daniel.)
Fine. Even still. Keep me in check, and keep your promises.
(That's up to you, on both accounts.)
You won't help?
(I'll only help when you ask me to.)
Why can't you help when I don't ask you to?
(Oh I can interject, but there's nothing I can do if you choose to ignore me.)
What if I don't want to ignore you?
(Is that an honest question?)
Yes!
(Then you should honestly ask yourself if you think you'll always remember that.)
Will I?
(No.)
Mmhmm.
(There you have it.)
So what do I do?
(Get help.)
Like professional help? This whole conversation thing is a little on the crazy side, after all.
(We're all crazy, Daniel.)
This is weird.
(Well, you're weird. Learn to love it. I do.)
Well at least someone does.
(More that just one someone.)
That's reassuring.
(It's honest.)
That's the theme, isn't it?
(Is indeed.)

How long is this conversation going to be?
(As long as you keep going.)
I want it to end and I also don't want it to end.
(Well then that's a choice in your pocket, isn't it?)
Yup.
(A word of warning, my friend. If you continue to spend time in only this manner, you will lose sight of God's desires for you. You will waste your talent and atrophy into a stupor.)
I don't want that.
(Neither does God, nor I.)
Ok, well, then where do I go from here?
(Anywhere.)
Thanks, Cat.
(Truly. You know your blessings, and also your duties. Fulfill your responsibilities, as you know you ought.)
Ok. Meanwhile, I will maintain an upbeat and uplifting attitude. Thanks, Daniel.
(I'm always here, Daniel.)
Thanks.
Love you.
(Love you too, man.)

Thanks, God. We love you.
(We do.)
