A good question is usually a response to being very present. Paying attention matters.

But I've also been listening to a few podcasts that get me curious and childlike. I find myself asking very basic questions lately, mostly about life. Small curiosities like "why do trees grow tall" and "why do they stop at a certain height." I'm not asking for the literal scientific reason––which is that they compete with their peers and predecessors for sunlight, water, and nutrients, and stop once they get as much as they need––but because of the metaphor. How tall will I grow? Which forest am I in?

My favorite podcasts (as of today) are:
- Krista Tippet's On Being. I recommend [this one with Paul Muldoon][paul-muldoon] about poetry or [this one with David Steindl-Rast][david-steindl-rast] on gratitude.
- Stephen Dubner and James Altucher's [Question of the Day][qotd]. A lighthearted fifteen minutes of banter over Quora's top questions with no conclusion. Thought-provoking and encourages independent thought.
- Freakonomics Radio with Stephen Dubner. I recommend [this one][freakonomics] about the education crisis in America. Also, no clear answers.
- Philosophize This with Steven West. Too many favorites, but here are four: [this one][pt-insecurity] on insecurity, [this one][pt-limits] on the limits of knowledge, [this one][pt-argument] on how to win an argument, and [this one][pt-hegel] one Hegel's definition of God.

So maybe, I find the best questions have unclear answers. They're ones that push me to keep exploring, anyway.
