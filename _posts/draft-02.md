Keep your attention on the small details, but force nothing. Let what isn't obvious be seen, and allow yourself to be moved by intuition.

Intuition, call it the spirit, the daemon, or gut, runs naturally in the body the same way breathing does. But feelings and emotions are not the guiding spirit, those are signals and must be read.
