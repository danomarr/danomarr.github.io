The art of [wabi-sabi][wabi-sabi] has a lovely effect through the eye to the soul. It follows the organic path of life, allowing and even highlighting imperfections, and then pruned to be beautiful. The magic is in celebrating uniqueness by removing clutter. Nature becomes the guide, and human hands are there to tend its organic progression––to cut away the unwanted scrap and weeds, and let the spring flourish with blooms and green.

Japanese gardens follow wabi-sabi wonderfully. I remember seeing my first Japanese garden when my family stayed at Kildrummy castle in Scotland. By comparison, seeing the Versailles gardens impressed me, sure––but they failed to inspire any recognition of beauty in my eyes like Kildrummy. The warped and twisted Versailles estate mirrored the aristocratic tyrant who made it. There is no beauty in excess and conformity. Wabi-sabi, however, stays at the human scale, and because of that, it is relatable, intimate, and sincere.

Can wabi-sabi be applied to work?

Many talented people have already answered this, and frankly quite better than I can today. If this topic matters to you, go find these people. Read them. I've listed the ones I have found, in no specific order, in another post about [my role models and inspiring sources of goodness][inspiration]. If you are interested in my take on it, I'll give it my best.

So, can wabi-sabi be applied to work?


### The workplace is a garden.  


We tend to think of companies as machines that respond to direct orders the way a computer does. Input this, output that. If your company doesn't, then you're already ahead of the curve. Still, the headline story I'm hearing is that management (just read any Harvard Business Review article) obsesses over the productivity of their teams, copy-pasting buzzwords like "empowerment" and "agile methods" and expecting it to make a positive impact.

The root of the problem is with linear thinking. Humans are not machines, and simply swapping out mechanistic words for softer or more human sounding words doesn't shift the underlying beliefs of if-this-then-that thinking.

But Dano! you say, clearly you don't know about NLP or persuasion! You've never had to sell a set of kitchen knives to frustrated housewives, run a marketing initiative, or managed *this* team of troglydytes! You just don't get it. To which I reply, I know bro, I know. And I too read The Game in college, watched Tony Robbins, and I know about LifeHacker and the Law of Attraction, and How to Win Friends And Influence People. And no, I haven't got much personal experience as a manager for large, complex projects or huge unwieldy teams. But that is to my advantage, because I haven't swallowed "just the way things are."

So let's go off this premise that you believe people are programmable, like Elon Musk believes, and you want to associate with his glorious brain in some small way. If this tidbit encourages you to believe you can influence the behavior of your company, or that marketing team, with some "management hacks" or some stand-in vision statement, then I'm sorry but I think you've missed the point.

Linear thinking is a mistake *even in thinking about how computers work.* Paul Ford opened my eyes in [this charming and exhaustive 7-chapter article (book?) about how code works][what-is-code]. Programming is so literally and deeply linear, that I took for granted how complex and ingrained just my laptop's operating system is. What seems linear now is actually systemically interdependent, languages signaling and interacting with each other in order to perform seemingly basic functions like typing on a blank screen. The development of computing, while built on binary zeros and ones, mimicked the rest of life in a survival-of-the-fittest kind of way, depending deeply on communities of support, radical decisions, and a constant evolution that is more like the evolution of human language than discovering maths (even though code is logical and tends to use a lot of numbers). Computing has grown organically despite its linear nature. Computers are now closer to an aspen grove than an abacus.


That's how complex things work. People and organizations also follow a very *organic* way of being (there's even a hint in the word's roots). And complex things evolve their own nature, and will grow the way they will. Try to hack it or swap out parts and it will have unintended consequences down the line––the same way debugging hacked code taunts programmers and dealing with overcropped land curses farmers. The problem is the hacking in the first place. Linear, prescriptive solutions do not fix a company or a human being any more than carving a living tree.


### Gardens must be tended.


I believe that the secret magic is quite ordinary, when compared to a motivational seminar touting unlocking superhuman abilities. It is more like a gardener's simple and patient discipline. He attentively cares for the plants over time, giving them what they need to grow, and letting life take its course. A gardener cannot ignore his own participation in his garden. He is not the source of problems or solutions (unless he neglects his work), but he plays an important part of the whole. A gardener is not the "driving force" of the garden, he is only the keeper.

And if we are a whole group of farmers and gardeners at our jobs––then we are not the "driving forces" at our work, but the keepers of our work. So easily  leadership forgets that they are not generals, but gardeners. I too, forget  I am a gardener, and everything I do has an effect on our garden.

Maybe the analogy breaks down a little when we start exchanging flowers for projects and trees for people and red tape for weeds. But the underlying principle holds.


### Tending requires systems thinking.


It is very easy to understand systems thinking when thinking of gardens. Plant the seed in good soil with enough sun, and water it. But it doesn't end there. The seed needs day and night and more water, repeatedly spread out over time. And it happens in cycles at a steady pace to survive the winter until it can grow again, so long as it gets the right amount of sunlight and water. Everything affects the way the plant grows. But, as Peter Senge describes in The Fifth Discipline, systems thinking is somehow missing in much of the work world. He does an incredibly good job simplifying systems thinking, and I will distill that book in another post someday. If you can't wait, you should [definitely read that book][the-fifth-discipline].

Similarly, everyone has an impact, whether we mean to or not. Me, you, your receptionist, your managing director, and your CEO. The problems I see in my organization, the frustrations I have, I participate in creating and continuing. It doesn't mean it is my fault or my responsibility. But when I acknowledge that I am co-creating the very problems that frustrate me, then I can be less frustrated with people. I can choose to take responsibility in affecting them. If everyone realized we are a part of our own difficulties, then we have the space to dialogue them. When we take that space, we can collaborate to a achieve a different output.

So why don't we?

There is a proverb about a farmer, saying: "It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops." I grew up in a Christian home, and despite no longer practicing the faith, this message from 2 Timothy has stuck with me.

Meditating on it, I understand I cannot be much help to others so long as I am helpless myself. It's why "in the event of loss of cabin pressure…first secure your mask before assisting others." It's a truth we can't sneak around. We're pretty damn useless trying to help other people before we're safe ourselves.

So how do I know whether I am helpless or helped? Speaking from personal experience, I feel like I'm in the hole when I feel alone. The key here is to jump out and connect with other humans who will give you the same attention a gardener would. If you *do not have that freedom* then that should be your immediate first priority. Find people you can be yourself with, and take the time to grow together. Feed yourself, and then you will be able to have the metaphorical—or literal—strength to pull weeds and water the plants. (And don't forget, you have to eat every day. It doesn't end after doing it once.)

Think of gardening. Tend your own garden. Tend the garden of your workplace. Tend the garden of the company. It isn't spectacular or exciting or magical, and it takes time and patience and commitment to the little things that allow life to grow.
