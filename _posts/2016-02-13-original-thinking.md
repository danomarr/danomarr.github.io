How can I have an original thought?

I've heard that novelty is a myth. The rule is this: new ideas only form by smashing two things together that haven't collided before in a unique way. But what if that's not true? Or not the only way? What if the key is not in the mashup of the two things, but in the question that brought them together? Maybe imagination is less about popping out an answer and building up how "awesome" and "creative" it isâ€¦and is more inquisitive and thoughtful.

What if we did *this*?
